## Movement

Increase/decrease acceleration on keydown
~ #html/event/key-down
  up = #html/event/key-down.key == "ArrowUp"
  down = #html/event/key-down.key == "ArrowDown‚Äù
  left = #html/event/key-down.key == "ArrowLeft"
  right = #html/event/key-down.key == "ArrowRight"
  #spaceship.vy{up} :=  5
  #spaceship.vx{right} := 5
  #spaceship.vy{down} :=  -5
  #spaceship.vx{left} :=  -5

Stop spaceship on keyup
  ~ #html/event/key-up
  up = #html/event/key-up.key == "ArrowUp"
  down = #html/event/key-up.key == "ArrowDown"
  left = #html/event/key-up.key == "ArrowLeft"
  right = #html/event/key-up.key == "ArrowRight"
  #spaceship.vx{left | right} := 0
  #spaceship.vy{up | down} := 0

Move spaceship at set speed
~ #time/timer.ticks{1}
  #spaceship.x := #spaceship.x + #spaceship.vx
  #spaceship.y := #spaceship.y + #spaceship.vy

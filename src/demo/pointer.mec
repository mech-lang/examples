# Pointer

Keep track of which balls are clicked
  ~ #gravity
  #clicked = #balls.x != #balls.x

Determine if the pointer is within the ball's hitbox
  ~ #html/event/pointer-move
  dx = #html/event/pointer-move.x - #balls.x
  dy = #html/event/pointer-move.y - #balls.y
  #hover = ((dx ^ 2 + dy ^ 2) ^ 0.5) < #balls.radius

Click the circle
  ~ #html/event/pointer-down
  #clicked{#hover} := true

Un-click the circle
  ~ #html/event/pointer-up
  #clicked{#hover} := false

Move the circle to the pointer if it's clicked
  ~ #html/event/pointer-move
  #balls.vx{#clicked} := 0
  #balls.vy{#clicked} := 0
  #balls.x{#clicked} := #html/event/pointer-move.x
  #balls.y{#clicked} := #html/event/pointer-move.y
